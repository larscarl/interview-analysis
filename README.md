  - **Sentence-Level Analysis**: Explore the sentiment polarity for each sentence in a tabular format.
  - **Polarity Timeline (Interactive)**: Visualize sentiment changes over the text with an interactive scatter plot and smoothed trendlines.
  - **Sentiment Distribution**: View the polarity distribution using histograms.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
  - Extract entities like names, organizations, locations, and more using advanced NLP techniques.
  - Highlight entities directly in the text with interactive filters for entity types.
  - Display detailed tables of extracted entities and their occurrences.
  - View entity type distributions with bar charts.
- **Multilingual Support**: Analyze texts in English, German, or French.
